This is what the game looks like with the PRM nodes visible. You can also turn on the routes for each

Features I attempted:
-   Single Agent Navigation 
-   3D Rendering & Camera 
-   Improved Agent & Scene Rendering 
-   Incorporate Particle System 
-   User Scenario Editing+ 
-   Crowd Simulation
  
  
  
Difficulties I ran into:
-   The biggest thing I think I ran into was that my partner dropped the class near the middle/end of this project which really left me in a time scramble to put this together.
-   I didn't realize I could split crowd simulation and part 2 up, so I implemented a sort of crowd simulation into part 2 which honestly was really tough.
-   Since I incorporated crowd simulation into part 2, I kept running into issues where my program would slow down, since there were so many computations being done.
-   I havent used processing before, so it took alot to get used to.
-   I ran into the same issue of scene rendering destroying my computer as I tried to load a background image and have each obstacle have it's own image.
-   The code is a big mess, because I was handed a bunch of things I didn't write and thought I could just build on top of it. Turns out I can build on top of it, but it is really difficult to parse and understand.
-   For some reason, everything is a little laggy. Maybe its because I am running it on an older computer, but everything I do takes a second or so.

- I got the idea of SphereLoc from https://github.com/erich666/T2Z/blob/master/src/ProjectT2Z/Animations.pde. Which made it easier for me to create spheres.
